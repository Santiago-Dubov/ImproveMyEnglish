# ImproveMyEnglish
An Alexa Skill I developed as part of the ALTA hackathon in december 2020. The app allows A1 english learners to respond to prompts from several different categories e.g meeting up with a friend. 
The user's responses are recorded by Alexa and sent to the Write and Improve API which checks their grammar and the allows us to give suggestions and improvements for the learner's grammar.
